    <h2>Developers</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Setup your KNIME as described in <a href="#/quiuckstart">Quickstart</a></li>
        <li>Download dev branch from GitHub repository. Decompress it if necessary.</li>
        <li>Run <i>eclipse.exe</i></li>
        <li>Choose <i>File</i> -> <i>Import</i> and then in <i>Plug-in Development section</i>, choose <i>Plug-ins and Fragments
            </i>. Click <i>Next</i>.
        </li>
        <li>In next step, in:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Import From</i> select <i>Directory</i> and choose the directory of your git cloned repository.</li>
                <li><i>Plug-ins and Fragments to Import</i> select <i>Import plug-ins and fragments required by existing
                    workspace plug-ins</i>
                </li>
                <li><i>Import As</i> select <i>Projects with source folders</i></li>
            </ul>
            Click <i>Next</i>.
        </li>
        <li>Numerous projects should appear. Select them all, and click  <i>Finish</i>.</li>
        <li>Now you have to compile it. To do so, right-click on any of imported projects seen on the right (eg.
            ic-depress-examples) and choose <i>Run As</i> -> <i>Eclipse Application</i>. (The same thing you can do by
            clicking the button on the top with a white arrow in a green circle.)
        </li>
        <li>New eclipse instance should execute with all DePress plugins loaded. Open KNIME Perspective.</li>
        <li>In the new instance, you should be able to find DePress plugins in <i>Node Repository</i> window(if you can
            not find this window, the link in the third point of KNIME instruction can be useful).
        </li>
        <li>Now you are ready to create KNIME Workflow. Right-click on <i>Local(Local Workspace)</i> in KNIME Explorer
            window. Choose <i>New KNIME Workflow</i>. Type the name of your workflow and you can start using plugins.
        </li>
        <li>In the directory with KNIME application you can find an useful document called <i>Quickstart</i>. There is a
            lot of information about starting work with as well KNIME as plugins. We recommend checking it out.
        </li>

    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>All DePress files are stored on GitHub. To create new stuff or add changes to this project, first download
            the GitHub application from the GitHub site. It will be also useful to have the Git Shell.
        </li>
        <li>Fork the DePress repository into your account(remember to do it being on dev branch).</li>
        <li>Connect your account with the application on your computer.</li>
        <li>After making any change in the DePress repository, application will be ready to commit them. It will
            synchronize your copy stored on computer with the GitHub page. If you can not see
            your changes in the GitHub application, please check if you are still on the <i>dev</i> branch.
        </li>
        <li>To add changes to the main DePress repository, visit your GitHub page and click <i>Pull Request</i>. Do not
            do it after each change. Do it after completing your whole task.
        </li>
        <li>Your changes will not be seen until somebody admits them and merges the repositories - yours and the main.
        </li>
